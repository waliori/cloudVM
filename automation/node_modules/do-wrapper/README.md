## Install

`do-wrapper` is available on the `npm` repository and as such, can be installed with `npm`.

To install `do-wrapper` and add it to your `package.json`, use the following command:

```sh
$ npm install --save do-wrapper
```

## Usage

In order to use the library, you'll first need to provision a `Personal Access Token` for your Digital Ocean account.

Once you've got a `Personal Access Token`, make a note of this somewhere safe, as you won't be able to view it again.

In your project, initialise a new instance of the Digital Ocean wrapper:

```js
const DigitalOcean = require("do-wrapper").default;
// oe
import DigitalOcean from "do-wrapper";

const instance = new DigitalOcean('{personal_access_token}');
```

Once you've created an instance, you can use it to access the many groups of features provided by the wrapper, like so:

```js
instance.account.get()
    .then(data => console.log(data))
    .catch(err => console.error(err));
```
**Note:** you can view the data behind the error by accessing `err.response`, this is provided by the underlying request library

The available features are:

* `account`
* `actions`
* `cdn`
* `certificates`
* `databases`
* `domains`
* `droplets`
* `firewalls`
* `floatingIPs`
* `images`
* `keys`
* `kubernetes`
* `loadBalancers`
* `projects`
* `regions`
* `reports`
* `sizes`
* `snapshots`
* `tags`
* `volumes`
